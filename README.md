a web page i am developing.
it's basically just memes at the moment but I hope to keep adding features.
I am making this as I learn more about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Shrek belongs to Dreamworks,
I got the memes from ImgFlip
and I wrote the code with help from some tutorials on W3schools.com

also you can look at my code to see how I did stuff but please don't, you know, steal my whole site :)

Thanks for reading this and I hope you enjoy my site
